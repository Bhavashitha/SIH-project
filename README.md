The Aqua Avengers – AI-Driven Unified Marine Data Platform is a cutting-edge solution developed for Smart India Hackathon 2025, designed to break long-standing silos in marine research by integrating oceanographic, fisheries, and molecular biodiversity (eDNA) data into one intelligent ecosystem. Marine datasets often exist in fragmented, inconsistent, and multi-format sources, making research slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale. Our platform solves this challenge by providing a fully automated system that handles data ingestion, cleaning, validation, storage, and AI-powered analysis through a modular, cloud-ready architecture. Built using Python, R, Node.js/React, TensorFlow, PyTorch, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MinIO, and BLAST+, the system ensures seamless processing of both structured datasets (like fisheries numbers, ocean parameters) and unstructured sources (images, taxonomy records, molecular sequences). The platform integrates advanced ML models for species classification, biodiversity trends, and otolith morphometrics, while the molecular module enables eDNA storage and species matching using BLAST search. Interactive dashboards built with D3.js and Plotly allow researchers, students, and policymakers to visualize real-time environmental conditions, species distribution, and conservation indicators. A collaborative workspace further enables users to co-create, annotate, and analyze marine datasets with ease.
